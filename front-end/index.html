        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>This is an interactive visualization of Brazilian flights ranging from
            January 2000 to October 2020. It's a final examproject for the data visualization course at the university
            École Polytechnique and was made by the students Aloysio Galvão Lopes and Igor Albuquerque Silva.</p>

        <p> You have access to three main windows that interact with each other to show
            different aspects of flights data. The main idea is that in each window you can select some specific aspects
            of the flights that you want to visualize.</p>

        <h2> The map window </h2>
        <img src="data/map.png" alt="Map Modes" width=940>
        <p> In the map window you can visualize the flights in a graph that shows the origins
            and destinations in a map. There are three different modes of visualization in this window: routes, airports
            and planes.
            All of the modes can be superposed so you can even visualize all of them at the same time.</p>

        <p> In that same window you can also select Brazil and individual states in Brazil. If you click in Brazil it'll
            appear highlighted and
            only flights with origin and destination in Brazil will be considerd. If you click outside Brazil
            international flights will again be considered and Brazil will no
            longer be highlighted. In the same way, if Brazil is hightlighted and you click in an individual state only
            flights that involve that state will be considered, you can select
            multiple sates in Brazil to see the routes considering just those states. Again you should deselect all of
            the selected states or click outside Brazil to reset the selection. The picture above shows some examples of
            selections.
        </p>

        <p> The three existing modes are explained in more detail below:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> The first mode is routes, in this mode you can visualize the planes routes'. Their relative
                    importance is shown by the color intensity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> The second mode is airports, in that mode you can visualize the airports. Their relative importance
                    is show as the area of the circle that is over a given airport. If you place your mouse over an
                    airport you can see other inforation, such as the name and the number of flights in the current
                    selection.
                </p>
            <li>
                <p> The last mode is planes, in this mode you can visualize individual planes. The planes shown in this
                    mode are not real, they are simulated based on the data of the current selection.
                    In this mode you can see the relative speed of given routes as well as if the routes are delayed. A
                    delayed plane appear in red if the daley is greater than 15 minutes. This means that if a route has
                    lots of red planes you know that the planes are delayed very often in that route. If you hover over
                    an inividual plane it'll become yellow meaning that this plane is selected. When
                    a plane is selected additional information about that plane and it's route are shown in the bottom
                    right corner of the map. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> You are also able to change the zoom on the map by using the mouse scroll or the touchpad. </p>

        <h2> The timeline window </h2>
        <img src="data/slider.png" alt="Timeline" width=940>
        <p> The timeline window lies just below the map window and its purpose is to select the flights based on a
            given period.</p>

        <p> The complete period visible in this window will act as the considered period for all of the other
            windows. You can change the considered period by zooming in this window (using your mouse scroll or touchpad
            to zoom) and by clicking and draging left or right. The default selection will cover all of the data, form
            January 2000 to October 2020.</p>

        <p> This window also shows the flights activity in a line plot that is drawn over the period. This plot is
            not intended to provide accurate information, but rather to facilitate the navigation in this view and
            convey a qualitative comparison.</p>

        <h2> The histograms window </h2>

        <img src="data/types.png" alt="Types" width=940>

        <p>This window, situated at the bottom, consists of two plots, one that provides information about flights types
            and other that provides information about airlines.</p>

        <h3>The flights types plot</h3>

        <p>This is the bottom left plot. It's a veritcal bar plot that shows information about the number of flights
            which belong to the six most important categories (by number of flights) in the current selection. A
            flight category is a classification given by ANAC (the regulatory agency in Brazil), some examples are:
            domestic, regional, internaticonal etc.</p>

        <p>The vertical axis show the number of flights, that information is in logarithmic scale (in simple terms
            this means that the axis varies in powers of 10). We made this choice because the number of flights varies
            considerably based on the flight type. </p>

        <p>As in all of the other windows, this plot is interective. If you click in any bar you will select only
            flights that belong to the type that corresponds to the selected bar. You can select multiple bars, but if
            you want to clear the selection you must deselect every bar that you selected. It's important to note that
            all of the other windows will be updated when you change the selection in this window. This plot also
            changes if you change the selections in other windows. </p>

        <h3>The airlines plot</h3>

        <p>This is the bottom right plot. It's a horizontal bar plot that shows information about the number of
            flights which belong to the ten most important airlines (by number of flights) in the current selection.</p>

        <p>The vertical axis shows companies codes and if you hover over the correspondent bar you can view the name
            of each company, the horizontal axis shows the number of flights by company that reflecst the current
            selection on the other windows. </p>

        <p>You can select only one airline at the time, by clicking in the correspondent bar to study their routes
            and flights, if you click outside the bars the selection is cleared. As for the other cases, every other
            window will be updated by interacting with this window and this window will also change in response to
            changes on the other windows.</p>

        <h2>Simple use case</h2>

        <p>We know that this visizualisation is considerably complex and the variety of options can be a littel bit
            overwhelming at a first glance. We suggest that initially you try to explore it and keep in mind that almost
            everything is clickable and interacts with each other. If you make some king of selection, it'll affect all
            of the other views.</p>

        <p>Try to study the flights in given region of Brazil by selecting states on Brazil's map. After that try to
            seelct only some companies.</p>

        <p>After tht you can click on the ocean and then select only international flights, you can filter again by
            companies and select American Airlines for example, then, activate the planes mode and hover over some plane
            to see the dalay and the flight duration.</p>

        <p>Finally, you can hover over some airports to see additional information (be sure to have the airports mode
            activated) and change the period to, for example 2020 to see the impact of the COVID crisis on the flights.
        </p>

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>This project is based on a dataset freely available at ANAC's (Brazil's National Agency of Civil Aviation)
            <a class="reference_link"
                href="https://www.anac.gov.br/assuntos/dados-e-estatisticas/historico-de-voos">website</a>.
            There was a considerable preprocessing effort to cleanup the data, so if you wish to use it directly be
            warned. We chose to do this visualization as we both are Brazilians so we decided to visualize something
            related to Brazil, at the same time, flights data offer plenty of useful information to create rich
            visualizations.
