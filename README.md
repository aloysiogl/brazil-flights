# Brazil Flights

This repository contains the implementation of an interactive visualization of Brazilian flights ranging from January 2000 to October 2020. It's a final exam project for the data visualization course at the university École Polytechnique and was made by the students Aloysio Galvão Lopes and Igor Albuquerque Silva.
